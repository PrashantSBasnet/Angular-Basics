module.ts
app.module.ts
index.html <app-route> loads app.component.ts
app.component.ts -- html, css and all..


Components
app.component is on top of other components. add other components on it


components
	- used to build web pages (UI)
	- empty typescript class (eg AppComponent {} ) and we transfer it into something else by add a decorator @NgModule({})
	


module
	to bundle different pieces/functionality of app (eg.components of app) into packages
	empty typescript class (eg AppModule {} ) and we transfer it into something else by add a decorator @NgModule({})


why we import typescript classes (like server.component) without .ts extension?
-because the extension is added by webpack which bundles our project automatically
-angular when runs will know that server.component.ts is a part of the app
